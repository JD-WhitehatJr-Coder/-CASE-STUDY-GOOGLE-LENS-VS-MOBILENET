# -CASE-STUDY-GOOGLE-LENS-VS-MOBILENET
Story:

R-kart is a big international company which has a business of ecommerce. Recently they have integrated new technologies on their ecommerce website. Now they want to add an Image Identification system in their ecommerce website such that a user shows an image of a product and that image gets identified and added to the shopping cart.
So they are confused on deciding which method to use:

Google Lens
OR
Use Mobilenet.

So to get rid of this confusion they want someone who is working with Mobilenet model to do a case study/research on which of the methods is more accurate.

I am required to do a CASE STUDY between my application (which you are making in the class 130) which uses Mobilenet and Google Lens.
